How did viewing a diff between two versions 
of a file help you see the bug introduced?

It allowed me to compare lines of text for variations.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

File history access will make you more efficient because it will not
only allow you to locate errors more quickly, it will also you to detect your
programming error patterns.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically
saved, like Google docs does?


Pros: You have control and they are more logical
Cons: You may forget to save or save too often.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat eac file separately?

I would imagine that some systems want to focus specifically on the individual changes
while others wnat to maintain a relationship between files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff
to view the history of files?

With git log, you can view a history of the committs with a description
of what the changes were. With git diff, you can view the actual changes that were made.
